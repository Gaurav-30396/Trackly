# Trackly – Your Daily Task Progress Companion

Trackly is a simple and efficient Android app built with Jetpack Compose to help you manage the small but important tasks you perform every day. Whether it is studying, exercising, journaling, or following a routine, Trackly ensures you never forget what needs to be done.

Trackly lets you create daily tasks, track their completion, and stay consistent through clear visual progress.

## Features

### Create Daily Tasks
Add tasks you need to remember throughout the day. Trackly keeps them organized and easy to access.

### Toggle Task Completion
Each task includes a toggle switch so you can mark it as completed with a single tap.

### Circular Progress Tracker
A clean circular progress bar fills as you complete tasks, giving you instant visual feedback on your daily progress.

### Delete Tasks
Remove tasks from the list whenever needed.

### Reset All Tasks
A dedicated Reset button instantly turns off all toggles and resets the circular progress bar back to zero.

### Persistent Storage with Room
Trackly stores all tasks using Room Database, keeping them saved across app restarts.
